# PI
calculating the value of pi
# Background 
pi is the ratio of perimeter of the circle to the diameter

# Basic technique used
let a square whose side is 2r where r is 1
let a circle inside the square whose radius is r
the area of square is a^2 so a =2r
the area of circle is pi*r^2
so the ratio of area of circle divided by the area of square
                = pi*r^2 / 4r^2
               so the ratio is pi/4
               
similarly if we take the random point in the whole plane the 
probability that the point will land inside the circle is 
                    = points land in circle / total number of points thrown
     
this ratio should also equal to the ratio of area
               pi/4 = total number in circle / total number of points
               pi = 4 * total number in circle / total number of points
